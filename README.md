# Shortread datasets of U1 snRNP (obtained from Mangilet et al., 2024) and AGO4 datasets (obtained from Meng et al., 2022) were compared to determine the role of AGO4 in splicing
# nextflow pipeline is used to study transcriptome-wide analysis of splicing events in both datasets
# python codes were run to extract data from Pln24NT website
# R pipeline is used for differential gene expression analysis
